# template-circuits
Template circuits used for Electrical/Firmware Workshops.
We have included circuit schematics for multiple motor drivers that we want to test.
The list of motor driver's that we have compared are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1mb3v_e_vz5CGWMooNBc84SeT_yCwtlZyatwRbS5gVKg/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=108362044059836433502).
The bolded motor drivers are the ones we decided to purchase for testing.

There is also a PCB schematic avaliable so we can breakout these motor drivers on a breadboard. This is going to be used for rapid prototyping.
